        <p>
            PowerShell is like a library of applications. If you're like me, sometimes
            you go to the library and you just browse. Let's start out by browsing the
            PowerShell library. Run the following code in your PowerShell terminal.
        </p>

        <pre class="code-block"><span class="code-function">Get-Command</span></pre>

        <p>
            You're going to see a whole lot of commands scroll by. Each
            <span class="keyword">command</span> in PowerShell can be thought of as an
            application. I was overwhelmed by that information - let's look in the
            library for a specific application - like using a catalogue to find a single
            book. Run the following code in your PowerShell terminal.
        </p>

        <pre
            class="code-block"><span class="code-function">Get-Command</span> <span class="code-parameter-name">-Name</span> <span class="code-parameter-value">'gcm'</span></pre>

        <p>
            Let's take a look at the output of of our command.
        </p>

        <pre class="code-block">
<span class="code-label">CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------</span>
Alias           gcm -> Get-Command
</pre>

        <p>
            We have a table of information, presented as text, telling us about the commands
            that are available. That's like looking in the library catalogue and seeing the
            books they have!
        </p>

        <p>
            The result we see is a command, which is a tool that we can run in PowerShell.
            Much like an application we can run it, but instead of opening a window, most
            commands only run in the terminal.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are a few different types of commands. We want to be accurate with our
            terminology, but this is more technical than you probably need right now; feel
            free to come back and read this section again later.
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li>
                <h4 class="keyword">Script</h4>
                <p>
                    A script is a PowerShell file (ending in <span class="keyword">.ps1</span>)
                    which can be run by PowerShell. It's the simplest way to make a reusable
                    group of PowerShell code. You can run a script by typing the full name of the
                    script file in the terminal, e.g. <span class="code-inline">./path/to/script.ps1</span>.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4 class="keyword">Function</h4>
                <p>
                    A function, like a script, is a bunch of PowerShell code that runs
                    together. Instead of running a file, you can define or load a function
                    in PowerShell and it'll stick around until you close the window.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Functions are generally easier to use because you don't have to worry
                    about where the file is located, but there are some considerations
                    to take into account which we'll take about in the next article.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4 class="keyword">Cmdlet</h4>
                <p>
                    A cmdlet is a special type of function that is written in a dotnet
                    language like C# (or F# or Visual Basic) and compiled into a DLL.
                    Because they can't be written directly in PowerShell they're a little
                    more complicated to write, but they tend to be more consistent,
                    reliable, and performant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm writing a series on
                    <a href="series/pwsh-to-csharp">how to learn C# by writing PowerShell cmdlets</a>
                    that you can check out after this series.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4 class="keyword">Application</h4>
                <p>
                    An application is an executable program (on Windows that's a file ending in
                    <span class="keyword">.exe</span>) that PowerShell can run. Like a command
                    prompt, PowerShell can run these. They're more portable that the other
                    PowerShell command types because they generally don't require PowerShell to
                    run, but they are less useful in PowerShell that the other types of commands
                    because they only accept text input and output. While we see things as text
                    in PowerShell, what we are dealing with often enough are actually rich objects
                    with descriptive values called <span class="keyword">properties</span>
                    and ways to interact with those values called <span class="keyword">methods</span>.
                    Because applications only support text input/output (to be compatible with
                    non-PowerShell use), it's preferable to use the other types of commands
                    whenever possible.
                </p>
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            So there are different types of a command, but from a use perspective
            they're pretty much the same. You type the name of the command, and you
            hit enter. The command does something - maybe it changes a setting, maybe
            it displays information. Let's create a command!
