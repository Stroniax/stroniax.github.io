        <p>
            The best way to learn is by doing, and in application development it's often the
            case that we learn and do, learn more and redo. While most tutorial series <i>do</i>
            lots of little things, I've always found it better to learn by building and
            iterating over a product - since that's what I do in the real world anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
            A simple card game, like War, can be used to teach a lot of programming concepts
            as well as the tools provided by PowerShell - including simple concepts like
            variables and loops, to more advanced strategies like async programming and
            inter-process communication. Throughout this series we will start with the basics
            - what PowerShell is - and work our way to a master's level of understanding of
            PowerShell code. We will prioritize reliability with testing and code re-use, and
            emphasize quality-of-life like argument completions and consistent error reporting
            that help users of your product.
        </p>

        <p class="opinion">
            This is an opinionated series. I'll try to be clear when I'm giving a practice that
            I recommend for consistency's sake, but like all things with programming, your mileage
            may vary. You know the application you're building better than I do; if you need to
            do something differently than I, that's your perogative.
        </p>

        <p>
            As always, feel free to jump around and find the concepts you need to learn more about.
            Personally I never read a tutorial from start to finish - I find something relevant to
            my needs and learn the associated concepts. However, this is designed as a consecutive
            course so it's likely to teach you most completely if you process it in order.
